# Fizzbuzz

This is my first project in JavaScript, using Jasmine as the testing framework. It was created to help learn the basics of JS syntax and begin the process to becoming a great JS developer!

## What is it?
Simple fizzbuzz code that outputs the following:

1 => 1<br>
2 => 2<br>
3 => Fizz<br>
4 => 4<br>
5 => Buzz<br>
...<br>
...<br>
15 => FizzBuzz

Code includes TDD files to test using Jasmine!


## Running the test
Open 'SpecRunner.html' in your browser to run the Jasmine tests.
